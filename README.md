DNSViz

DNS Visualization Tool designed to provide a real-time representation of DNS traffic on a network.
Information about records accessed will be presented, covering records handed out by the server. Statistics will be displayed about all packets captured during the current capture period.
Information about requests and reponses outside of the host network will be presented on a map, giving a geographic representation of the location of addresses being resolved by the tool.
Additonally, failed DNSSec validations will be recorded and displayed.
